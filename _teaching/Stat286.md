### Course Abstract

 Substantive questions in empirical scientific and policy research
 are often causal.  Does voter outreach increase turnout?  Are job
  training programs effective?  Can a universal health insurance
  program improve people's health?  This class will introduce students
  to both theory and applications of causal inference.  As theoretical
  frameworks, we will discuss potential outcomes, causal graphs,
  randomization and model-based inference, sensitivity analysis, and
  partial identification.  We will also cover various methodological
  tools including randomized experiments, regression discontinuity
  designs, matching, regression, instrumental variables,
  difference-in-differences, and dynamic causal models.  The course
  will draw upon examples from political science, economics,
  education, public health, and other disciplines.
