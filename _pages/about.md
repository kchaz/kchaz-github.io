I am a Ph.D. student in the [Harvard Department of Statistics](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/) advised by [Kosuke Imai](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/) and [Xiao-Li Meng](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/people/xiao-li-meng). My research interests are in:

- Missing data problems (including data combination and causal inference).
- Data collection, de-duplication, privacy protection, and other aspects of data (pre)processing pipelines and their downstream consequences.
- All this especially for social science applications.

I also love to read and think about the history, philosophy, and sociology of statistics.
